# Wildfire Simulator

A JavaScript toy to demonstrate wildfire propagation. See it in action at [https://gould.io/fire](https://gould.io/fire)

Greener areas represent denser vegetation and will burn more readily. Current wind is indicated by the directional arrow at the top of the screen.

The Ignite tool at the top of the screen is selected by default. To inhibit the spread of fire, select the Firebreak tool, and click around the map to remove fuel from those areas. Then re-select the Ignite tool, and click unburned areas of the map to advance the fire.

The progress indicator reflects the percentage of land area burned so far. Press the Reset button to generate a fresh, unburned map.
